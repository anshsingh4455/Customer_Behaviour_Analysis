# **Customer Behaviour Analysis – Data Analytics Project**

A full-cycle data analytics project that covers **data loading in Python, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL querying, dashboard development in Power BI, and an insights report** created using Gamma tools.
This project demonstrates my ability to work across multiple tools in a real analytics workflow—from raw data to business insights.

---

## **📂 Project Overview**

This project analyzes customer shopping behaviour using a real-world dataset.
The workflow includes:

* Loading and inspecting data in **Python**
* Performing **EDA and data cleaning**
* Running analytical **SQL queries** using PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server
* Designing an interactive **Power BI dashboard**
* Creating a structured **data insights report**
* Preparing a clean **presentation (PPT)** using Gamma

---

## **📊 Tools & Technologies**

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **SQL** (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)
* **Power BI**
* **Gamma App** for report & presentation
* **GitHub** for version control

---

## **🔍 Steps Performed**

### **1. Data Loading (Python)**

* Imported dataset into Python using Pandas
* Checked dataset structure, types, and basic statistics
* Identified early issues such as duplicates & missing values

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Summary statistics and distribution analysis
* Visual exploration (customer segments, purchase frequency, spending patterns)
* Identification of trends, seasonal behaviours, and anomalies

### **3. Data Cleaning**

* Handling missing values
* Removing duplicates
* Treating outliers
* Standardizing formats (dates, categories, and numerical fields)
* Creating new features for better analysis

### **4. SQL Analysis**

Executed SQL queries to validate insights and perform aggregations such as:

* Total sales and customer counts
* Most purchased product categories
* Customer segmentation by frequency/spending
* RFM-style analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

### **5. Power BI Dashboard**

Built an interactive dashboard including:

* Sales trends
* Customer demographics
* Buying frequency & behaviour
* Category-wise performance
* Key metrics & KPIs

### **6. Insights Report (Gamma)**

Created a clean, easy-to-read report containing:

* Key business findings
* Visuals from the dashboard
* Actionable recommendations

### **7. Final Presentation (PPT)**

Prepared a professional presentation summarizing:

* Problem statement
* Approach
* Key findings
* Recommendations

---

## **📈 Results & Key Insights**

Some major insights uncovered in this project (example placeholders):

* High-value customers show strong preference for specific categories
* Weekend traffic shows significantly higher transaction volume
* Certain demographic groups have higher repeat purchase behaviour
* Inventory alignment opportunities based on seasonal spikes

*(Replace with your actual insights if needed.)*
